# buttercup

`buttercup` language, created for the [langjam 1](https://github.com/langjam/jam0001)

## Design

The official theme of the jam: "first-class comments".

The interpretation:
- How many different types of comments are there when programming?
- What could we empower people to do, if there legitimately were many different types of comments?
- What kind of features could there be, if we focused on comments as a primary goal?
